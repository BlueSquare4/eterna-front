- Sorting Functionality: Enable sorting for each column in the token table to allow users to organize tokens based on different criteria (e.g., price, volume).
- Hover Effects and Click Actions: Incorporate hover effects for visual feedback and click actions for deeper interaction with token rows (e.g., redirect to token details page).
- Real-time Price Updates: Integrate mock real-time price updates via WebSocket, with smooth color transitions to visually represent price changes.
